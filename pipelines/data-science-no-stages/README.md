# data-science-no-stages

An example of a pipeline without stages.

This stage is used in the [Popper SWC Lesson]() to illustrate how stages can be 
added, modified and deleted for an existing pipeline. Also, the lesson uses this 
pipeline to exemplify some of the problems with dependency management, since 
some of the packages required in for the pipeline to execute might not be 
available in the machine where this pipeline is being executed.
